# Format families

Reached from `SKILL.md` step 1 (finding the gaps), step 4 (writing drafts and the ledger) and step 5 (validating the file). One rule covers every format; this file shows what the rule looks like in the families that come up most, so the agent recognizes it faster, and says what to do with a format it does not list.

## The rule

A **gap** is an entry present in the source file with no non-empty counterpart in the target file, in that format's own notion of an entry — plus any entry the format itself marks as needing work. A target file that does not exist yet is all gaps. A target value that merely equals the source is **not** a gap by itself: `OK` is `OK` in German, and a CI export made without `--skip-untranslated-strings` fills every untranslated key-value entry with source text, which is exactly why step 2 passes that flag before counting.

A **draft** is written into the target file in place, mirroring the source file's structure: same entry order, quoting, indentation, headers and comments, changed only where the translated text goes. A new target file mirrors the source file's structure entirely. The source file is never touched. The one shape where it is: a **multilingual** file (`multilingual: true` in `crowdin.yml`, such as `.xcstrings` or a CSV with a `scheme`) holds every language, so `translation` resolves to the source file itself. There the language's entries are the target, the source-language entries stay untouched, and the git gate in step 2 applies to that file.

A **plural** is written in the format's own plural mechanism, with exactly the categories `crowdin language list --verbose` printed for the target language.

## The families

| Family | Typical files | A gap looks like | Plurals look like | Also preserve | Validate with |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gettext PO | `messages.po`, `*.po` | `msgstr ""`, any empty `msgstr[n]`, or a `#, fuzzy` flag (re-draft it and drop the flag); `#~` obsolete entries are left alone | `msgid_plural` with `msgstr[0]…msgstr[n-1]` in the order the header's `Plural-Forms` defines — that header must agree with the CLI's categories | header block, `#:` references, `#.` comments, `msgctxt`, line wrapping style | `lingui compile` for Lingui (as a validator even when the bundler compiles at build time; delete its output files then), else `msgfmt -c` |
| key-value: JSON, YAML, `.properties`, Apple `.strings` | `en.json`, `en.yml`, `messages.properties`, `Localizable.strings` | key missing from the target, or present with an empty value | ICU inside one string (`{count, plural, one {…} other {…}}`) or the library's own sibling keys (`_one`, `_other`, `one:`/`other:`) — follow whichever the source uses | key order, nesting, escapes, trailing newline | `jq` for JSON, `yq` for YAML, `plutil -lint` for `.strings` |
| Android XML | `res/values*/strings.xml` | `<string name="…">` absent from the target file | `<plurals name="…"><item quantity="one">…</item>…</plurals>`, one `item` per category | `translatable="false"` strings are never gaps; escaped apostrophes, `\n`, `%1$s` ordering | `xmllint --noout` |
| Apple stringsdict and xcstrings | `Localizable.stringsdict`, `Localizable.xcstrings` | a key with no entry for the language, or an empty `stringUnit` value; `.xcstrings` is a multilingual file, so the draft goes into the language's own `localizations` entry of the source file | stringsdict: `NSStringPluralRuleType` dictionaries with one key per category; xcstrings: `variations.plural` with one key per category | `NSStringFormatSpecTypeKey`, `%#@variable@` names | `plutil -lint` |
| ARB | `app_en.arb` | key missing from the target | ICU inside the string, as in key-value | `@key` metadata blocks are source-only, never copied into the target unless the source's target files already carry them | `jq` |

## Library checks

Some libraries ship a catalog check that applies the rule for you, and when one exists it beats reading the files. Lingui, from 6.8 on, has two:

- `lingui check sync --locale <source locale>` proves the source catalog matches the code. It compares each catalog file byte for byte with what `lingui extract` would write, which is why it is asked about the source locale only: a target catalog Crowdin exported differs from Lingui's own serialization (a trailing newline, for one) and fails the comparison without being stale. A failure on the source locale means `lingui extract` has not run; run it before the upload in step 2, because uploading a stale catalog and drafting against it is wasted work. Extract rewrites every locale's catalog, so revert the target catalogs afterwards (the download replaces them) and leave the source catalog for the user to commit. Mirror the flags the team extracts with (`--clean`, `--overwrite`), or the check compares against output the team never produces; `--verbose` names the catalog that failed.
- `lingui check missing --locale <locale> --mode catalog --verbose` lists that locale's gaps before drafting, and after the write it must exit `0`: that is the proof that no gap was left behind. `--mode catalog` matters: the default resolved mode hides a gap whenever a fallback locale covers it.

An older Lingui reports `unknown command 'check'`; then `lingui extract` followed by `git diff -- <catalog root>` answers the sync question (a changed source catalog was stale), and the rule above counts the gaps as for any PO file. What the two commands do in depth belongs to the `lingui-best-practices` skill, not to this file.

## A format not listed here

Read the source file and its target sibling (if one exists) and apply the same rule: what is one entry, what makes it empty, how does this format spell a plural, and what surrounds the text that must survive. When the format's notion of an entry is unclear — a document format, a binary, a custom syntax — stop and ask rather than guess. Document formats (Markdown, HTML, DOCX) are outside this skill by design: they are documents, not keyed strings.

## The drafts ledger

Every draft is appended to `.crowdin/translate/drafts-<language id>.jsonl` before it is written into the target file, one JSON object per line:

```json
{"file":"src/locales/de/messages.po","key":"Order","source":"Order","target":"Bestellen"}
{"file":"res/values-uk/strings.xml","key":"items_count","source":{"one":"%d item","other":"%d items"},"target":{"one":"%d елемент","few":"%d елементи","many":"%d елементів","other":"%d елемента"}}
{"file":"src/locales/de/messages.po","key":"Log","skipped":"noun or verb; no reference into the code"}
```

- `file` is the target file path; `key` is the format's own identifier for the entry (msgid, JSON path, XML `name`).
- `source` and `target` are strings for plain entries and category-keyed objects for plurals. For ICU-in-a-string plurals, the ledger holds the branch texts by category, not the whole ICU expression — that is what lets the check compare placeholders per form — and any surrounding text outside the braces is expanded into every form (`You have {count, plural, one {# item} other {# items}}` becomes `{"one":"You have # item","other":"You have # items"}`). An ICU `select` is recorded the same way, keyed by its selectors (`{"male":"He left","other":"They left"}`); the check tells the two apart by the keys, holds a plural to the language's categories and a select to the source's own branch set.
- A skipped entry carries a `skipped` reason and no `target`.
- When a language's drafting fans out in chunks (see "Large runs"), each worker appends to its own part, `drafts-<language id>-<n>.jsonl`, and the main thread concatenates the parts into the language's ledger before step 5 and deletes them.

The ledger is format-neutral, so `scripts/check-drafts.sh` checks a PO catalog and an Android file identically. It is the audit trail, the input to step 5, the source of the per-language table, what a per-language worker hands back, and the resume point: a run that stopped before upload leaves it in place, and the next run for that language verifies and uploads from it, or starts over on the user's word.
